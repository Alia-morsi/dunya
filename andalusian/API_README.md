Arab-Andalusian API
============

This document describes the API to access information about the Arab-Andalusian data
in Dunya.

Other APIs
----------
See also documentation for the docserver API in `docserver/API_README.md`

Authentication
--------------
You must authenticate in order to access API resources. Do this by sending a header

    Authorization: Token <token>

with your request. You can get the token on your dunya profile page at
http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/social/profile/

Methods
-------

We are currently working hard on making the Arab-Andalusian data available in Dunya.
We expect to have a working version of the API for Arab-Andalusian music by mid-July 2014.
The API methods will be very similar to the [Carnatic Music API](https://github.com/MTG/dunya/blob/master/carnatic/API_README.md)
