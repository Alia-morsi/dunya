Installation
============

    apt-get install postgresql python-dev python-virtualenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade distribute
    pip install -r requirements

Running
=======

To run the server:

    source env/bin/activate
    fab up

Development
===========

In the data module there are 5 abstract classes:

 * Artist
 * Composer
 * Work
 * Concert
 * Recording

These classes store fields that are common to all cultures.

They also store lookup properties that are common over all styles, e.g.,
`concert.performers()`

Each style has replicas of these classes that can inherit from these
abstract classes.

The abstract classes also provide the `get_absolute_url()` method, to be used
when referring to an object.

both `get_absolute_url` and property lookups require data (class names, url fragments) that
are common to the specific culture. Because of this, you need to create a StyleBase class
which implements two methods. Here is an example:

    class CarnaticBase(object):
        def get_style(self):
            return "carnatic"
        def get_object_map(self):
            return {"performance": InstrumentPerformance,
                    "concert": Concert
            }

You need an object map for each of the abstract classes.

A specific culture has a concrete class inheriting from the base class ''first'' and
then the abstract data class

    class Concert(CarnaticBase, data.models.BaseConcert):

Any fields that are specific to this culture can be added to this specific class.

Templates
=========

To get the application chrome, add this to the top of the template

    {% extends "browse/base.html" %}

and put the contents of the template inside

    {% block wrap %}
    ...
    {% endblock %}

Template files should be saved in `modulename/templates/modulename/templatename.html` and can be
refered to in a view as `modulename/templatename.html`

Template fragments
==================

Commonly used parts of code are added to template fragments.

We need a better description about how to name these and what the arguments should be.

Inline links
============
When linking to an entity, never construct a link manually. Instead, make sure the template contains

    {% load extras %}

and use the provided `{% inline_x thex %}` methods. These will automatically create a link and
the best form of the objects name.
